Does a little bit of cleaning up to files translated by lingojam. Lets say the creator of Shakespear'ian is a lazy bastard and just copy pasted every file in the English files into [Shakespearean](https://lingojam.com/EnglishtoShakespearean), and lingojam (stupid pos app) fucked the formatting, that wont fucking work because the game will look crappy with spaces at the beginning of newlines and non-capitalized words. Blows my mind lingojam missed that.

If the script works slowly, thats because it is slow. It isnt simple to read every file and correct every little mistake

How to is very confusing because I made the program very confusing

## How-to

Drag the folder of your translation into this folder

Add the folders full name to `folder.json`

Run `node .`
