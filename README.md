Copy the folder of the translation you want to use, and paste in the `Translations` folder in SCP: SLs files

# How to add your translation

If you are savvy enough, make a pull request. Otherwise you can just message `ICodeInAssembly#7117` your translation in a zip. Make sure to include a description of your translation in your message

# Scripts

The scripts folder is a folder which contains possibly useful scripts. Don't bother using them if you cannot understand how to use them!

## Adding a script

To add a script, create a folder under the `scripts` folder, and add your script and a little bit of documentation to a readme. If in doubt, check out the already available scripts
